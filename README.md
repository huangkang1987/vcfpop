# vcfpop
Performing population genetics analyses based on NGS data for haploids, diploids, autopolyploids and aneuploids.

The functions of VCFPOP consist of: 
1.	Variant information, individual, genotype and locus filters; 
2.	Calculate statistics for sliding windows;
3.	Haplotype extraction from phased genotypes;
4.	File format conversion;
5.	Genetic diversity index estimation and genotypic equilibrium test;
6.	Individual statistics estimation (inbreeding coefficient, kinship coefficient, heterozygosity);
7.	Genetic differentiation index estimation and test;
8.	Genetic distance estimation;
9.	Analysis of molecular variances;
10.	Population assignment;
11.	Relatedness coefficient estimation;
12.	Kinship coefficient estimation;
13.	Principal coordinate analysis;
14.	Hierarchical clustering;
15.	Bayesian clustering.
