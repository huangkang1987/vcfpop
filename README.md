# vcfpop
Performing population genetics analyses based on NGS data for haploids, diploids, autopolyploids and aneuploids.

The functions of VCFPOP consist of: 
1.	Variant information, individual, genotype and locus filters; 
2.	Haplotype extraction from phased genotypes;
3.	File format conversion;
4.	Genetic diversity index estimation and genotypic equilibrium test;
5.	Individual statistics estimation (inbreeding coefficient, kinship coefficient, heterozygosity);
6.	Genetic differentiation index estimation and test;
7.	Genetic distance estimation;
8.	Analysis of molecular variances;
9.	Population assignment;
10.	Relatedness coefficient estimation;
11.	Kinship coefficient estimation;
12.	Principal coordinate analysis;
13.	Hierarchical clustering;
14.	Bayesian clustering.
