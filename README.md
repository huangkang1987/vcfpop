# vcfpop
Performing population genetics analyses based on NGS data for haploids, diploids, autopolyploids and aneuploids.

The functions of VCFPOP consist of: 
1.	Variant information, individual, genotype and locus filters; 
2.	Differentiation, divergence, diversity, evolutionary parameters, inbreeding statistics for sliding windows; 
3.	Linkage-disequilibrium estimates between blocks; 
4.	Linkage-disequilibrium decay as distance; 
5.	Genome-wise association study; 
6.	Haplotype extraction from phased genotypes; 
7.	File format conversion; 
8.	Genetic diversity index estimation and genotypic equilibrium test; 
9.	Individual statistics estimation (inbreeding coefficient, kinship coefficient, heterozygosity); 
10.	Genetic differentiation index estimation and test; 
11.	Genetic distance estimation; 
12.	Analysis of molecular variances; 
13.	Population assignment; 
14.	Relatedness coefficient estimation; 
15.	Kinship coefficient estimation; 
16.	Principal coordinate analysis; 
17.	Hierarchical clustering; 
18.	Bayesian clustering.
